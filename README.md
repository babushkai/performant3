- **SwiftUI Interface** - Modern, responsive UI with dark mode support
- **Model Management** - Track, version, and manage ML models locally
- **Training Integration** - Python training script integration with progress monitoring

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- Xcode 15.0+ (for building from source)

## Installation

### From Release
